wp-reconfigure.sh
=================
A rebuild of the python wp-reconfigure but in bash so that I can more easily throw options/flags at it, etc. 


### Roadmap:
- v0.4: help file in place
- v1.0: a weeks' worth of testing without issue

### Release History:
- v0.0: Something to start from
- v0.1: basic manual mode works
- v0.3: basic current mode works
